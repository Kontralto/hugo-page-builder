Cloud computing has revolutionized the way we build and deliver software over the last decade and a half. It’s a common practice to lift and shift legacy applications into the cloud - but what about green field projects? In today’s cloud-first world we can unlock powerful and innovative architectures, delivery models, and operational methodologies that were previously only available to the big players.

A cloud-native approach lets us
- Reduce operational burdens
- Create more reliable, cost efficient, fault tolerant software
- Focus on cost efficiency and developer productivity
- Feel more confident in our software systems


We do this with mature technologies such as stateless applications running in lightweight containers, orchestration frameworks, immutable infrastructure deployed with declarative code, visibility and alerting driven by logs and metrics, to name a few. Kontralto is Cloud Native. Your software should be too. Message us today to discuss why Cloud Native Development is the right choice for your new software project.
