Security is non-negotiable in the cloud. Hackers can turn your cloud into a sieve. They exploit shortcomings with security, and this can become an endemic blind spot. Other non-security events like an acquisition often require security audits as well. Having good controls and observability in place sooner makes it much easier to cover any delta compared to building your security posture at the last minute.

Itâ€™s easy to set things off on the right foot:

* Principle of least privilege from the beginning
* Make privileged credentials break-glass only and alert when they are used 
* A baseline of sensible configs and alarms tailored to severity level


This low-hanging fruit is a great place to start, but more is needed. Starting security best practices from the outset of a project is ultimately the best approach - use CI/CD to inject automated security sensibilities into the development process. This can be done with CFNLint, container scanning, DAST/black-box application testing, and other tools.
