Systems can and do fail. These outages can be hard to navigate for a business. When your system tanks it drags other things with it - revenue, customer trust, irreplaceable data. A strong foundation in reliability engineering reduces outages and looks to mitigate the losses that are typically associated with downtime. 

Site reliability engineering is a set of principles and practices incorporating aspects of software engineering to infrastructure and operations concerns.

SRE in action often includes:
- Automation or elimination of anything repetitious
- Defining and measuring reliability goals
- System design biased toward risk-reduction for availability, latency, and efficiency
- Observability and alerting
- Change and release management for automated, low-risk deployment cycles
 
We do this by giving developers more ownership of their running system - which includes defining an outage budget, empowering them to study the Site Reliability Engineering principles, and most importantly, facing the operational responsibility of the systems they develop.

Systems can and do fail - but there is some good news here. We know that an outage is coming. Itâ€™s never if but rather when. Kontralto practices comprehensive DevOps principles - we apply rigorous software engineering practices to stabilize operations. And we can show you how to do this too. Message us today.
