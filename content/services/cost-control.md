Cloud-hosted environments can grow in unexpected ways when you’re not looking. Running a tight ship in the cloud requires some serious diligence - what resources are running? To whom do they belong? Are they efficient or wasteful? What applications interact with them? We need to know these things with certainty when running even modest cloud computing workloads.

Asset tagging involves attributing metadata to computing resources - which is the first step to auditing Where Your Money Goes. Knowing which team is responsible for uptime and which cost center owns the resource are both examples of invaluable business intelligence that resource tagging gives us. 

Asset identification helps you
- Understand how to budget developer time
- Optimize workloads for cost efficiency using automated scaling
- Identify and terminate expensive orphaned resources
- Develop profitable software pricing models
- Plan for disaster recovery
